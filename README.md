# PPE-Usage-Weather-Analysis
A statistical analysis exploring the relationship between weather conditions and personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, aiming to understand how temperature, humidity, and weather types can influence PPE compliance.

## Context
This analysis extends New York University's DETER project, funded by the National Science Foundation, which collected time-sensitive data on egress behaviors and neighborhood conditions around healthcare centers (HCCs) in New York City during the initial COVID-19 PAUSE ordinance from March 22 to May 19, 2020. The original dataset contains anonymized observational field data, with researchers recording details of egress behaviors, such as the day and time of travel, destination type, and surrounding weather conditions and socio-economic factors. This extension investigates how PPE usage correlates with environmental factors, including weather and temperature, and egress behavior. By analyzing data from NYC healthcare centers, the goal is to explore how these variables impacted PPE usage and egress patterns during the pandemic.

## Results and Analysis
The exploratory analysis involved univariate and bivariate visualizations to examine PPE usage trends over time, across weather types, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors. The results indicated certain weather conditions correlated with increased PPE usage, and variations in temperature and humidity also appeared to influence behavior.
